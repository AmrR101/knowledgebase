# We need to talk about

## Who they are  
	-  PI for the lab
		- PI seniority (implications for HSCI funding eligibility)
	- institute
	- how they found out about us

## The actual science and biology  
	- what the lab works on
	- what the researcher works on
	- applicability to disease (translational research)
	- is it stem cell related (potential HSCI funding)

## Technical issues
	- organism
	- type and number of comparisons
	- samples groups
	- technique
	- potential batches

## Funding 
- who is paying for the work 
	- what commitments are entailed by that

## Time frame
- is this urgent
	- for paper, manuscript or grant
	- upcoming meetings?
	- need to do quik QC before continuing with experiments?

## Who will be doing the work
	- advice or analysis?
		- advice - important to assess skill of researcher, have clarity that we cannot train, debug code or mentor, can only point to resources
		- analysis - we will do it all and share results and code##

## Training needs
	- point to courses
	- point to materials

## Time estimate
- when we can start,
- how long it will take
- how much it will cost (if paying)

## Authorship expectations
- basic analysis - acknowlegement only, including any funding source
- advanced analysis - middle author for analyst, acknowledgement for funding source
	- we follow standard practices on intellectual contributions and authorship
	- offering authorship shows you value our efforts, helps us attract and retain qualified personnel and helps ensure continued funding 
	- we are skilled professionals and approach no project as routine, taking complete responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis, viewing your projects as opportunities to engage intellectually and venues to develop professionally

## Process outline/ Next steps
- Basecamp
- MOU delivery
- how billing works
- will followup with email when analyst ready
