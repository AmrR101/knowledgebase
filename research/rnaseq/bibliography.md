# Alternative Splicing

* [IsoformSwitchAnalyzer](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR/inst/doc/IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR.html) helps to detect alternative splicing. It would be good to try it and make some code templates.

# Normalization
* [Comparing the normalization methods for
the differential analysis of Illumina high-
throughput RNA-Seq data](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-015-0778-7). Paper that compares different normalization methods on RNASeq data.
