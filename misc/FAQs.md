# General
## Functional Analysis
What is geneRatio and bgRatio in overerpresentation analysis?

- The geneRatio is the {# of annotated genes assigned to term from input}/{# of input genes annotated}

- The bgRatio is the {# of annotated genes assigned to term from background}/{# of background genes annotated}

- The input is a list of candidate genes (i.e. list of significant DEGs) while the background is a list of all the genes in the study.

## Multiple testing correction
What is q-value and why do we need this?

Here is a pretty good slide about the need for multiple testing and how FDR is calculated :
